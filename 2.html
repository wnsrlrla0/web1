<h2>CSS란 무엇인가?</h2>
<P><a href="https://www.w3.org/Style/CSS/specs.en.html" target="_blank"  title="CSS W3C">Cascading Style Sheets (CSS)<a> is a <strong>style sheet <u>language</u></strong><br> used for describing the presentation of a document <br> written in a markup language such as HTML.<br>
CSS is a cornerstone technology of the World Wide Web, <br> alongside HTML and JavaScript.
CSS is designed to enable <br>the separation of presentation and content, including layout, colors, and fonts. <br>
<img src="css.jpg" width="100%">
</p><p><br> This separation can improve content accessibility, provide more flexibility <br> and control in the specification of presentation characteristics, enable multiple <br> web pages to share formatting by specifying the relevant CSS in a separate <br>.css file which reduces complexity and repetition in the structural content <br> as well as enabling the .css file to be cached to improve the page load <br> speed between the pages that share the file and its formatting.</p>
